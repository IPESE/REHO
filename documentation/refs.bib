    ABSTRACT={In the context of increasing concern for anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the residential building sector still represents a major contributor to energy demand. The integration of renewable energy sources, and particularly of photovoltaic (PV) panels, is becoming an increasingly widespread solution for reducing the carbon footprint of building energy systems (BES). However, the volatility of the energy generation and its mismatch with the typical demand patterns are cause for concern, particularly from the viewpoint of the management of the power grid. This paper aims to show the influence of the orientation of photovoltaic panels in designing new BES and to provide support to the decision making process of optimal PV placing. The subject is addressed with a mixed integer linear optimization problem, with costs as objectives and the installation, tilt, and azimuth of PV panels as the main decision variables. Compared with existing BES optimization approaches reported in literature, the contribution of PV panels is modeled in more detail, including a more accurate solar irradiation model and the shading effect among panels. Compared with existing studies in PV modeling, the interaction between the PV panels and the remaining units of the BES, including the effects of optimal, scheduling is considered. The study is based on data from a residential district with 40 buildings in western Switzerland. The results confirm the relevant influence of PV panels’ azimuth and tilt on the performance of BES. Whereas south-orientation remains the most preferred choice, west-orientationed panels better match the demand when compared with east-orientationed panels. Apart from the benefits for individual buildings, an appropriate choice of orientation was shown to benefit the grid: rotating the panels 20° westwards can, together with an appropriate scheduling of the BES, reduce the peak power of the exchange with the power grid by 50% while increasing total cost by only 8.3%. Including the more detailed modeling of the PV energy generation demonstrated that assuming horizontal surfaces can lead to inaccuracies of up to 20% when calculating operating expenses and electricity generated, particularly for high levels of PV penetration.}

    ABSTRACT={The expected increase of the penetration of distributed renewable energy technologies into the electricity grid is expected to lead to major challenges. As a main stakeholder, authorities often lack the appropriate tools to frame and encourage the transition and monitor the impact of energy transition policies. This paper aims at combining relatively detailed modeling of the PV generation potential on the building’s envelope while retaining the energy system optimization approach. The problem is addressed as a multiobjective, mixed-integer linear programming problem. Compared to the existing literature in the field, the proposed approach combines advanced modeling of the energy generation potential from PV panels with detailed representation of the district energy systems, thus allowing an accurate representation of the interaction between the energy generation from PV and the rest of the system. The proposed approach was applied to a typical residential district in Switzerland. The results of the application of the proposed method show that the district can achieve carbon neutrality based on PV energy alone, but this requires covering all the available district’s rooftops and part of the district’s facades. Whereas facades are generally disregarded due to their lower generation potential, the results also allow concluding that facade PV can be economically convenient for a wide range of electricity prices, including those currently used by the Swiss grid operators. Achieving self-sufficiency at district scale is challenging: it can be achieved by covering approximately 42–100% of the available surface when the round-trip efficiency decreases from 100 to 50%. The results underline the importance of storage for achieving self-sufficiency: even with 100%, round-trip efficiency for the storage, very large capacities are required. However, energy demand reduction through renovation would allow reaching self-sufficiency with half of the PV and storage capacity required.}

abstract = {Energy transition is blurring the boundaries between the demand and supply sides with growing participation of prosumer resources. The intensifying pace of electrification and digitalization during the past decade tends to continue, leading to potential techno-economic-social challenges in energy strategy. However, it remains difficult to quantify their impacts on a national-level energy system, due to the trade-offs between increasing energy applications and decreasing energy consumption thanks to efficiency improvement. Using Switzerland as a case study, this work unveils the combined effects of (a) macro-economic drivers, (b) climate temperature rise, (c) system optimization, and (d) digitalization, on the end-use demand and final energy consumption in four major energy sectors, considering: industry, residence, mobility, and services. A systematic bottom-up and top-down approach was adopted, taking into account historical data by sector. The results show that: (1) the overall electricity consumption tends to increase by 20%–32%, while fuel consumption drops by 38%–95%, leading to (2) a total energy consumption reduction by 16%–59%, including the contribution from digitalization 10%–30%. (3) ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) is likely to become increasingly energy intensive, accounting for 25%–35% of electricity consumption, but can play an energy-supplying role through (4) data center heat recovery, promising to cut 15% national heating demand. Finally, the study highlights the importance of an early planning on investment decision and system operation to accommodate the development of electrification and digitalization, in order to meet the carbon neutrality target by 2050.}

ABSTRACT={Integrating intermittent renewable energy sources has renders the power network operator task of balancing electricity generation and consumption increasingly challenging. Aside from heavily investing in additional storage capacities, an interesting solution might be the use predictive control methods to shift controllable loads toward production periods. Therefore, this article introduces a systematic approach to provide a preliminary evaluation of the thermoeconomic impact of model predictive control (MPC) when being applied to modern and complex building energy systems (BES). The proposed method applies an ϵ-constraint multi-objective optimization to generate a large panel of different BES configurations and their respective operating strategies. The problem formulation relies on a holistic BES framework to satisfy the different building service requirements using a mixed-integer linear programming technique. To illustrate the contribution of MPC, different applications on the single- and multi-dwelling level are presented and analyzed. The results suggest that MPC can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources within the built environment by adjusting the heating and cooling demand to the fluctuating renewable generation, increasing the share of self-consumption by up to 27% while decreasing the operating expenses by up to 3% on the single-building level. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the national-wide potential is performed by means of an extended implementation on the Swiss building stock.}

This paper presents a two-step multi-objective optimization approach to size both thermal and electrical energy systems in regard of thermo-economic performance indicators to suit consumer and grid operator interests. Several utilities such as storage, conversion systems, and RERs are hence modeled and formulated through mixed-integer linear programming. Simultaneously, the algorithm defines the optimal operation strategy, based on a model predictive control structure, for each deterministic unit embedded within the energy management system of the building to meet the different comfort and service requirements. The developed design framework is successfully applied on several energy systems configuration of typical Swiss building types. Different component sizes are analyzed, regarding the present investment cost and the self-consumption share. In addition, this paper presents a novel optimal design criteria based on the maximum cost benefits in the view of both the consumer and the distribution network operator.}

Given the prominent role of PV in energy transition pathways, modeling the existing power distribution infrastructure’s constraints and limitations is key for its reliable techno-economical analysis and expansion. As countrywide models of the distribution grids are, in general, not available, this paper first tackles the problem of estimating medium voltage (MV) distribution grids starting from publicly available datasets. It then proposes a method to estimate the PV generation hosting capacity of such grids and extend it through energy storage systems. As a final contribution and ultimate objective, this paper proposes a method to derive cost-optimal plans for countrywide deployment of PV generation and energy storage systems considering the MV power distribution infrastructure’s technical limitations. The distributed PV generation potential is modeled with high-spatially resolved capacity factors. Results are discussed using Switzerland as a case study},

  abstract = {The residential sector accounts for a large share of worldwide energy consumption, yet is difficult to characterise, since consumption profiles depend on several factors from geographical location to individual building occupant behaviour. Given this difficulty, the fact that energy used in this sector is primarily derived from fossil fuels and the latest energy policies around the world (e.g., Europe 20-20-20), a method able to systematically integrate multi-energy networks and low carbon resources in urban systems is clearly required. This work proposes such a method, which uses process integration techniques and mixed integer linear programming to optimise energy systems at both the individual building and district levels. Parametric optimisation is applied as a systematic way to generate interesting solutions for all budgets (i.e., investment cost limits) and two approaches to temporal data treatment are evaluated: monthly average and hourly typical day resolution. The city center of Geneva is used as a first case study to compare the time resolutions and results highlight that implicit peak shaving occurs when data are reduced to monthly averages. Consequently, solutions reveal lower operating costs and higher self-sufficiency scenarios compared to using a finer resolution but with similar relative cost contributions. Therefore, monthly resolution is used for the second case study, the whole canton of Geneva, in the interest of reducing the data processing and computation time as a primary objective of the study is to discover the main cost contributors. The canton is used as a case study to analyse the penetration of low temperature, CO2-based, advanced fourth generation district energy networks with population density. The results reveal that only areas with a piping cost lower than 21.5 kEuro/100 m(ERA)(2) connect to the low-temperature network in the intermediate scenarios, while all areas must connect to achieve the minimum operating cost result. Parallel coordinates are employed to better visualise the key performance indicators at canton and commune level together with the breakdown of energy (electricity and natural gas) imports/exports and investment cost to highlight the main contributors},

  abstract = {The built environment currently represents the largest sector in terms of final energy consumption, both in Switzerland and the European Union. Most of the associated energy services, such as space heating and potable hot water preparation, are mainly satisfied by the combustion of fossil fuels, typically oil and natural gas. Hence, within the current context of national energy transition towards a sustainable and environment-friendly service provision, the building sector is facing a major challenge to integrate both efficient conversion technologies and additional renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, an increasing penetration of the latter is not a straightforward task; solar power, a typical resource available in urban areas, is indeed intrinsically volatile which renders a full exploitation of the generated electricity highly compelling. The implementation of advanced mathematical modelling methods during the phases of both design and operation represent a promising cornerstone to successfully reach the objectives targeted by the transition program.  Using a model-based approach, the following thesis therefore attempts in contributing to the latter challenge through three main targets. The first aims at the development of a holistic and modular modelling framework to optimally size and operate building energy systems. In order to provide multiple good trade-off system solutions to the various stakeholders, the proposed method relies on an epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimisation techniques and ad hoc defined key performance indicators. A systematic implementation of the thus developed framework finally allows the large-scale analysis of modern and efficient building energy systems, both in view of future market opportunities and national environmental targets.  The second topic focuses on the study of multi-building energy systems and analyses the potential benefits from involving multiple end-users during the sizing process. Through an extended system scope, potential synergies of neighbouring building types arise and hence, the initial modelling framework is further developed accordingly. Additional shared unit technologies, such as inter-day storage and heating networks become interesting elements for buildings interaction and therefore are also integrated in the modelling framework. Finally, the third target addresses the quantification of potential ancillary services performed by different energy system configurations to power network operators. Using a representative set of flexibility request profiles, the modelling framework is systematically solved to assess the associated temporal load shifting potential in comparison to standard electrical battery energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {Energy communities are key actors in the energy transition since they optimally interconnect renewable energy capacities with the consumers. Despite versatile objectives, they usually aim at improving the self-consumption of renewable electricity within low voltage electricity networks to maximize the revenues of the community. In addition, energy communities are an excellent opportunity to supply renewable electricity to regional and national grids. However, effective price signals have to be designed to coordinate the needs of the energy infrastructure with the interests of local stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potentials of energy communities at the national level with a bottom up approach. A district energy system having a building scale resolution is modelled in a mixed integer linear programming problem. The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is applied to reduce the computational time. The methodology lies within the framework of renewable energy hub, characterized by a high share of photovoltaic. Both investments into energy capacities and their operation are considered. The model is applied on a set of typical districts and weather locations representative of the whole Switzerland. The extrapolation to the national scale revealed a heterogeneous photovoltaic potential throughout the country. The actual electricity tariffs promote maximal investment into photovoltaic panels in every region, reaching a capacity of 28 GW and generating 32 TWh per year. Since the forecast national energy need is between 12 and 18 TWh per year, a coordinated design is needed to prevent unnecessary investments. An uncoordinated design increases the total costs of the residential energy system by 31\% and curtails 24\% of the onsite gener ated electricity. Moreover, the CO2,eq emission of the unnecessary investment is equivalent to 9\% of the actual emissions in the residential sector},
