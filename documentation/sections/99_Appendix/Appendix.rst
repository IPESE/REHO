Appendix
+++++++++++++++++

In REHO, most of the model parameters can be given through additional files. However, there are default values
already implemented in the model, which are attended to be reported in this appendix.

Units
======

To define the units' costs, the price per unit installed and the unit lifetime are considered.
They are reported in Tables :ref:`tbl-building-units` and :ref:`tbl-district-units`.
