  abstract = {The recent geopolitical conflicts in Europe have underscored the vulnerability of the current energy system to the volatility of energy carrier prices. In the prospect of defining robust energy systems ensuring sustainable energy supply in the future, the imperative of leveraging renewable indigenous energy sources becomes evident. However, as such technologies are integrated into the existing system, it is necessary to shift from the current centralized infrastructure to a decentralized production strategy. This paper presents a method to identify a panel of technological solutions at the district level, intended to reduce complexity for the integration of decentralized models into a national-scale model. The framework’s novelty lies in combining a global sensitivity analysis for solution generation with clustering to identify typical configurations. The global sensitivity analysis is performed on a mixed integer linear programming model, which optimally sizes and operates district energy systems. The sensitivity analysis determines the most influential parameters of the model using the Morris method and provides a representative sampling of the solution space by leveraging the Sobol sampling strategy. The latter is then clustered using a density-based algorithm to identify typical solutions. The framework is applied to a suburban and residential Swiss neighborhood. The first outcome of the research is the high sensitivity of the model to energy carrier prices. As a result, Sobol’s sampling space separates itself into two system types: those based on a natural gas boiler and those relying on a combination of electrical heaters and heat pumps. For both types, the electricity demand is either fulfilled by PV panels or electricity imports. The identified configurations showcase that the framework successfully generates a panel of solutions composed of various system configurations and operations being representative of the overall solution space.},

  abstract = {Energy transition is blurring the boundaries between the demand and supply sides with growing participation of prosumer resources. The intensifying pace of electrification and digitalization during the past decade tends to continue, leading to potential techno-economic-social challenges in energy strategy. However, it remains difficult to quantify their impacts on a national-level energy system, due to the trade-offs between increasing energy applications and decreasing energy consumption thanks to efficiency improvement. Using Switzerland as a case study, this work unveils the combined effects of (a) macro-economic drivers, (b) climate temperature rise, (c) system optimization, and (d) digitalization, on the end-use demand and final energy consumption in four major energy sectors, considering: industry, residence, mobility, and services. A systematic bottom-up and top-down approach was adopted, taking into account historical data by sector. The results show that: (1) the overall electricity consumption tends to increase by 20\%–32\%, while fuel consumption drops by 38\%–95\%, leading to (2) a total energy consumption reduction by 16\%–59\%, including the contribution from digitalization 10\%–30\%. (3) ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) is likely to become increasingly energy intensive, accounting for 25\%–35\% of electricity consumption, but can play an energy-supplying role through (4) data center heat recovery, promising to cut 15\% national heating demand. Finally, the study highlights the importance of an early planning on investment decision and system operation to accommodate the development of electrification and digitalization, in order to meet the carbon neutrality target by 2050.},

  abstract = {A holistic approach, considering all the energy needs of a territory, should be adopted in the challenge of the energy transition. Synergies between the different end-use demand sectors must be developed, in order to optimize the efficient use of resources. The multi-energy system of the future will be integrated and coordinated, with renewable energy sources and decentralized capacities. Indeed, in a context of increasing urbanization worldwide, decentralized renewable capacities appear to be the key driver to decarbonize urban environments and foster the emergence of renewable energy hubs. Mutualized infrastructures need to be deployed at every stage of these hubs: from energy harvesting, transport, and storage; to mobility services and goods production. The most suited scope to study the deployment and promotion of these local capacities and shared infrastructures appears to be the district perspective. The financial and environmental benefits of a district integrated approach for the mutualization of capacities have been proved, but their implementation mechanisms remain understudied. The aim of this study is to characterize the contribution of storage technologies to ensure the energy balance of a territory, assess the associated investments to be made, and discuss the techno-economic and environmental performance of the whole system. Firstly, a district is defined as a renewable energy hub, by identifying the energy needs of the residents and the potential of endogenous resources. Then, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to offer a multi-objective optimization of energy resources at district-level. Finally, a characterization of the storage technologies available under the horizon 2050 is conducted and a set of technological solutions is created to serve as input to the optimization model. Although their robustness has not been assessed, the obtained results show several interesting im- pacts. First, storage implantation allows to foster Photovoltaic (PV) deployment until full penetration. Sides effects to this increased penetration are a growth of the exported electricity together with a reduction of the imports. While the the latter is beneficial, the export increase might put the electric grid at risk. Second, synergies between electric and heat storage technologies where demonstrated through an increased use of heat technologies. Lastly, long term storage was not demonstrated and additional work should be undertaken to validate the overall model. Finally, once the developed model is corrected with the proposed improvements, it aims to be integrated in a global comprehensive model whose final purpose is to assess the optimal level of mutualization of energy conversion and storage capacities in urban areas},

  abstract = {In the context of increasing concern for anthropogenic CO¡sub¿2¡/sub¿ emissions, the residential building sector still represents a major contributor to energy demand. The integration of renewable energy sources, and particularly of photovoltaic (PV) panels, is becoming an increasingly widespread solution for reducing the carbon footprint of building energy systems (BES). However, the volatility of the energy generation and its mismatch with the typical demand patterns are cause for concern, particularly from the viewpoint of the management of the power grid. This paper aims to show the influence of the orientation of photovoltaic panels in designing new BES and to provide support to the decision making process of optimal PV placing. The subject is addressed with a mixed integer linear optimization problem, with costs as objectives and the installation, tilt, and azimuth of PV panels as the main decision variables. Compared with existing BES optimization approaches reported in literature, the contribution of PV panels is modeled in more detail, including a more accurate solar irradiation model and the shading effect among panels. Compared with existing studies in PV modeling, the interaction between the PV panels and the remaining units of the BES, including the effects of optimal, scheduling is considered. The study is based on data from a residential district with 40 buildings in western Switzerland. The results confirm the relevant influence of PV panels’ azimuth and tilt on the performance of BES. Whereas south-orientation remains the most preferred choice, west-orientationed panels better match the demand when compared with east-orientationed panels. Apart from the benefits for individual buildings, an appropriate choice of orientation was shown to benefit the grid: rotating the panels 20° westwards can, together with an appropriate scheduling of the BES, reduce the peak power of the exchange with the power grid by 50\% while increasing total cost by only 8.3\%. Including the more detailed modeling of the PV energy generation demonstrated that assuming horizontal surfaces can lead to inaccuracies of up to 20\% when calculating operating expenses and electricity generated, particularly for high levels of PV penetration.}

  abstract = {The expected increase of the penetration of distributed renewable energy technologies into the electricity grid is expected to lead to major challenges. As a main stakeholder, authorities often lack the appropriate tools to frame and encourage the transition and monitor the impact of energy transition policies. This paper aims at combining relatively detailed modeling of the PV generation potential on the building’s envelope while retaining the energy system optimization approach. The problem is addressed as a multiobjective, mixed-integer linear programming problem. Compared to the existing literature in the field, the proposed approach combines advanced modeling of the energy generation potential from PV panels with detailed representation of the district energy systems, thus allowing an accurate representation of the interaction between the energy generation from PV and the rest of the system. The proposed approach was applied to a typical residential district in Switzerland. The results of the application of the proposed method show that the district can achieve carbon neutrality based on PV energy alone, but this requires covering all the available district’s rooftops and part of the district’s facades. Whereas facades are generally disregarded due to their lower generation potential, the results also allow concluding that facade PV can be economically convenient for a wide range of electricity prices, including those currently used by the Swiss grid operators. Achieving self-sufficiency at district scale is challenging: it can be achieved by covering approximately 42–100\% of the available surface when the round-trip efficiency decreases from 100 to 50\%. The results underline the importance of storage for achieving self-sufficiency: even with 100\%, round-trip efficiency for the storage, very large capacities are required. However, energy demand reduction through renovation would allow reaching self-sufficiency with half of the PV and storage capacity required.}

  abstract = {The transition towards renewable and decentralized energy systems is propelled by the urgent need to address climate concerns and advance sustainable development globally. This transformation requires innovative methods to integrate stochastic renewable sources such as solar and wind power and challenging traditional energy paradigms rooted in centralized and continuous energy production. The present study focuses on the Swiss energy system to explore the optimization of energy planning strategies that incorporate decentralized energy production within a centralized framework. Here, we show that a strategic approach to decentralization can significantly reduce annual system costs by 10\% to CHF 1230 per capita and increase self-consumption to 68\% of the decentralized PV production, emphasizing the need for a hybrid energy-planning model that balances centralized and decentralized models for enhanced system resilience, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This research underscores the strategic importance of diversifying energy sources, enhancing energy storage, improving grid flexibility, and laying a foundational framework for policy making and strategic planning. It encourages further investigation into climate impacts, technology synergy, and the integration of district heating, aiming to establish a resilient, sustainable, and autonomous energy future.},

  abstract = {Integrating intermittent renewable energy sources has renders the power network operator task of balancing electricity generation and consumption increasingly challenging. Aside from heavily investing in additional storage capacities, an interesting solution might be the use predictive control methods to shift controllable loads toward production periods. Therefore, this article introduces a systematic approach to provide a preliminary evaluation of the thermoeconomic impact of model predictive control (MPC) when being applied to modern and complex building energy systems (BES). The proposed method applies an ϵ-constraint multi-objective optimization to generate a large panel of different BES configurations and their respective operating strategies. The problem formulation relies on a holistic BES framework to satisfy the different building service requirements using a mixed-integer linear programming technique. To illustrate the contribution of MPC, different applications on the single- and multi-dwelling level are presented and analyzed. The results suggest that MPC can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources within the built environment by adjusting the heating and cooling demand to the fluctuating renewable generation, increasing the share of self-consumption by up to 27\% while decreasing the operating expenses by up to 3\% on the single-building level. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the national-wide potential is performed by means of an extended implementation on the Swiss building stock.}

  abstract = {The built environment currently represents the largest sector in terms of final energy consumption, both in Switzerland and the European Union. Most of the associated energy services, such as space heating and potable hot water preparation, are mainly satisfied by the combustion of fossil fuels, typically oil and natural gas. Hence, within the current context of national energy transition towards a sustainable and environment-friendly service provision, the building sector is facing a major challenge to integrate both efficient conversion technologies and additional renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, an increasing penetration of the latter is not a straightforward task; solar power, a typical resource available in urban areas, is indeed intrinsically volatile which renders a full exploitation of the generated electricity highly compelling. The implementation of advanced mathematical modelling methods during the phases of both design and operation represent a promising cornerstone to successfully reach the objectives targeted by the transition program. Using a model-based approach, the following thesis therefore attempts in contributing to the latter challenge through three main targets. The first aims at the development of a holistic and modular modelling framework to optimally size and operate building energy systems. In order to provide multiple good trade-off system solutions to the various stakeholders, the proposed method relies on an epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimisation techniques and ad hoc defined key performance indicators. A systematic implementation of the thus developed framework finally allows the large-scale analysis of modern and efficient building energy systems, both in view of future market opportunities and national environmental targets. The second topic focuses on the study of multi-building energy systems and analyses the potential benefits from involving multiple end-users during the sizing process. Through an extended system scope, potential synergies of neighbouring building types arise and hence, the initial modelling framework is further developed accordingly. Additional shared unit technologies, such as inter-day storage and heating networks become interesting elements for buildings interaction and therefore are also integrated in the modelling framework. Finally, the third target addresses the quantification of potential ancillary services performed by different energy system configurations to power network operators. Using a representative set of flexibility request profiles, the modelling framework is systematically solved to assess the associated temporal load shifting potential in comparison to standard electrical battery energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {The residential sector accounts for a large share of worldwide energy consumption, yet is difficult to characterise, since consumption profiles depend on several factors from geographical location to individual building occupant behaviour. Given this difficulty, the fact that energy used in this sector is primarily derived from fossil fuels and the latest energy policies around the world (e.g., Europe 20-20-20), a method able to systematically integrate multi-energy networks and low carbon resources in urban systems is clearly required. This work proposes such a method, which uses process integration techniques and mixed integer linear programming to optimise energy systems at both the individual building and district levels. Parametric optimisation is applied as a systematic way to generate interesting solutions for all budgets (i.e., investment cost limits) and two approaches to temporal data treatment are evaluated: monthly average and hourly typical day resolution. The city center of Geneva is used as a first case study to compare the time resolutions and results highlight that implicit peak shaving occurs when data are reduced to monthly averages. Consequently, solutions reveal lower operating costs and higher self-sufficiency scenarios compared to using a finer resolution but with similar relative cost contributions. Therefore, monthly resolution is used for the second case study, the whole canton of Geneva, in the interest of reducing the data processing and computation time as a primary objective of the study is to discover the main cost contributors. The canton is used as a case study to analyse the penetration of low temperature, CO2-based, advanced fourth generation district energy networks with population density. The results reveal that only areas with a piping cost lower than 21.5 k€/100 m2ERA connect to the low-temperature network in the intermediate scenarios, while all areas must connect to achieve the minimum operating cost result. Parallel coordinates are employed to better visualise the key performance indicators at canton and commune level together with the breakdown of energy (electricity and natural gas) imports/exports and investment cost to highlight the main contributors.},

  abstract = {Energy communities are key actors in the energy transition since they optimally interconnect renewable energy capacities with the consumers. Despite versatile objectives, they usually aim at improving the self-consumption of renewable electricity within low-voltage grids to maximize revenues. In addition, energy communities are an excellent opportunity to supply renewable electricity to regional and national energy systems. However, effective price signals have to be designed to coordinate the needs of the energy infrastructure with the interests of these local stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the integration of energy communities at the national level with a bottom–up approach. District energy systems with a building scale resolution are modeled in a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition is applied to reduce the computational time. The methodology lies within the framework of a renewable energy hub, characterized by a high share of photovoltaic capacities. Both investments into equipment and its operation are considered. The model is applied on a set of five typical districts and weather locations representative of the Swiss building stock. The extrapolation to the national scale reveals a heterogeneous photovoltaic potential throughout the country. Present electricity tariffs promote a maximal investment into photovoltaic panels in every region, reaching an installed capacity of 67.2 GW and generating 80 TWh per year. Placed in perspective with the optimal PV capacity forecast at 15.4 GW peak at the national level, coordinated investment between local and national actors is needed to prevent dispensable expenses. An uncoordinated design is expected to increase the total costs for residential energy systems from 12\% to 83\% and curtails 48\% of local renewable electricity.}
