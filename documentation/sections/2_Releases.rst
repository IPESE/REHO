Model foundations
------------------

The first developments of REHO model are related to Paul Stadler's thesis,
which presents the buildings modellization framework and serves as a basis for the AMPL model.

        **Abstract**

        The built environment currently represents the largest sector in terms of final energy consumption, both in
        Switzerland and the European Union. Most of the associated energy services, such as space heating and potable hot
        water preparation, are mainly satisfied by the combustion of fossil fuels, typically oil and natural gas. Hence,
        within the current context of national energy transition towards a sustainable and environment-friendly service
        provision, the building sector is facing a major challenge to integrate both efficient conversion technologies and
        additional renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, an increasing penetration of the latter is not a straightforward
        task; solar power, a typical resource available in urban areas, is indeed intrinsically volatile which renders a
        full exploitation of the generated electricity highly compelling. The implementation of advanced mathematical
        modelling methods during the phases of both design and operation represent a promising cornerstone to successfully
        reach the objectives targeted by the transition program.

        Using a model-based approach, the following thesis therefore attempts in contributing to the latter challenge
        through three main targets. The first aims at the development of a holistic and modular modelling framework to
        optimally size and operate building energy systems. In order to provide multiple good trade-off system solutions to
        the various stakeholders, the proposed method relies on an epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimisation
        techniques and ad hoc defined key performance indicators. A systematic implementation of the thus developed
        framework finally allows the large-scale analysis of modern and efficient building energy systems, both in view of
        future market opportunities and national environmental targets.

        The second topic focuses on the study of multi-building energy systems and analyses the potential benefits from
        involving multiple end-users during the sizing process. Through an extended system scope, potential synergies of
        neighbouring building types arise and hence, the initial modelling framework is further developed accordingly.
        Additional shared unit technologies, such as inter-day storage and heating networks become interesting elements for
        buildings interaction and therefore are also integrated in the modelling framework. Finally, the third target
        addresses the quantification of potential ancillary services performed by different energy system configurations to
        power network operators. Using a representative set of flexibility request profiles, the modelling framework is
        systematically solved to assess the associated temporal load shifting potential in comparison to standard electrical
        battery energy storage systems.

The extension towards a district-scale energy hub is the contribution of Luise Middelhauve's thesis,
which applies the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition algorithm to bypass the computation effort associated with numerous interacting buildings.
The thesis also focuses in particular on the role of integrating photovoltaic panels into neighbourhoods.

        **Abstract**

        Although inevitable, the process of transforming urban areas into sustainable living environments presents many
        challenges. The decentralization of the energy system, the interconnection of multiple energy carriers, and the need
        to account for conflicting interests renders it a complex task. As key stakeholders, authorities often lack
        appropriate decision tools to frame and encourage the transition and to monitor the impact of implemented policies.

        This work aims to provide useful insights into the role of districts as renewable energy hubs by showing
        requirements and highlighting constraints, leading to an increase in renewable energy penetration. The benefits and
        trade-offs between centralized and decentralized renewable energy hubs are emphasized to contribute to the ongoing
        discussion regarding sustainable urban planning.

        Mathematical programming is used to build a multi-objective optimization platform that integrates several renewable
        technologies with a special focus on solar integration. Specifically, this approach includes the role of the
        orientation of PV panels and the use of facades, including mounting partly shadowed PV panels and
        receiving solar heat gain. A decomposition algorithm (Dantzig-Wolfe) is used to bypass the computation effort
        associated with centralized energy hubs at the district scale.

        The results highlight that a low-emission electrical grid mix has a high impact on sustainable design of renewable
        energy hubs at the building scale and led to less independent system configurations. Optimally integrating of solar
        systems had a significant impact on their interaction with the electrical grid: rotating the panels 20° westwards
        reduced the grid exchange peak by 50% while increasing cost by only 8.3%. Moreover, the studied district could
        achieve carbon neutrality based on PV energy alone, whereas self-sufficiency is more ambitious that confirmed
        the importance of storage systems: even with 100% round-trip efficiency of storage systems, the required ratio of
        area covered in PV modules to the ERA was 0.44 and 16% of available facades were needed to be covered with PV modules
        . However, energy demand reduction through thermal renovation would allow self-sufficiency with half of the PV and
        storage capacity.  Overall, this work demonstrates that moving from a decentralized to coordinated and centralized
        design strategy allows a higher electrification rate and an increased integration of renewable energy in the
        district for the same total expenses. The centralized investment strategy differed most from the decentralized
        strategy for PV panels; using the centralized strategy, a wide range of PV installation on less--optimal surfaces
        became economically interesting. The most economically convenient solution to overcome transformer limitations were
        district storage for peak shaving and photovoltaic curtailment. The cost increase were around 600 CHF per kWyr annual
        capacity shortage, regardless of the considered district energy system.

    **Abstract**

    Energy transition is blurring the boundaries between the demand and supply sides with growing participation of prosumer resources. The intensifying pace of electrification and digitalization during the past decade tends to continue, leading to potential techno-economic-social challenges in energy strategy. However, it remains difficult to quantify their impacts on a national-level energy system, due to the trade-offs between increasing energy applications and decreasing energy consumption thanks to efficiency improvement. Using Switzerland as a case study, this work unveils the combined effects of (a) macro-economic drivers, (b) climate temperature rise, (c) system optimization, and (d) digitalization, on the end-use demand and final energy consumption in four major energy sectors, considering: industry, residence, mobility, and services. A systematic bottom-up and top-down approach was adopted, taking into account historical data by sector. The results show that: (1) the overall electricity consumption tends to increase by 20%–32%, while fuel consumption drops by 38%–95%, leading to (2) a total energy consumption reduction by 16%–59%, including the contribution from digitalization 10%–30%. (3) ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) is likely to become increasingly energy intensive, accounting for 25%–35% of electricity consumption, but can play an energy-supplying role through (4) data center heat recovery, promising to cut 15% national heating demand. Finally, the study highlights the importance of an early planning on investment decision and system operation to accommodate the development of electrification and digitalization, in order to meet the carbon neutrality target by 2050.

    **Abstract**

    In light of the energy transition, it becomes a widespread solution to decentralize and to decarbonize energy systems. However, limited transformer capacities are a hurdle for large-scale integration of solar energy in the electricity grid. The aim of this paper is to define a novel concept of renewable energy hubs and to optimize its design strategy at the district scale in an appropriate computational time. To overcome runtime issues, the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method is applied to a mixed-integer linear programming framework of the renewable energy hub. Distributed energy units as well as centralized district units are considered. In addition, a method to perform multi-objective optimization as well as respecting district grid constraints in the decomposition algorithm is presented. The decomposed formulation leads to a convergence below 20 min for 31 buildings and a mip gap lower than 0.2%. The centralized design enhances the photovoltaic penetration in the energy mix and reduces the global warming potential and necessary curtailment in order to respect transformer capacity constraints.

    **Abstract**

    The expected increase of the penetration of distributed renewable energy technologies into the electricity grid is expected to lead to major challenges. As a main stakeholder, authorities often lack the appropriate tools to frame and encourage the transition and monitor the impact of energy transition policies. This paper aims at combining relatively detailed modeling of the PV generation potential on the building’s envelope while retaining the energy system optimization approach. The problem is addressed as a multiobjective, mixed-integer linear programming problem. Compared to the existing literature in the field, the proposed approach combines advanced modeling of the energy generation potential from PV panels with detailed representation of the district energy systems, thus allowing an accurate representation of the interaction between the energy generation from PV and the rest of the system. The proposed approach was applied to a typical residential district in Switzerland. The results of the application of the proposed method show that the district can achieve carbon neutrality based on PV energy alone, but this requires covering all the available district’s rooftops and part of the district’s facades. Whereas facades are generally disregarded due to their lower generation potential, the results also allow concluding that facade PV can be economically convenient for a wide range of electricity prices, including those currently used by the Swiss grid operators. Achieving self-sufficiency at district scale is challenging: it can be achieved by covering approximately 42–100% of the available surface when the round-trip efficiency decreases from 100 to 50%. The results underline the importance of storage for achieving self-sufficiency: even with 100%, round-trip efficiency for the storage, very large capacities are required. However, energy demand reduction through renovation would allow reaching self-sufficiency with half of the PV and storage capacity required.

    **Abstract**

    In the context of increasing concern for anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the residential building sector still represents a major contributor to energy demand. The integration of renewable energy sources, and particularly of photovoltaic (PV) panels, is becoming an increasingly widespread solution for reducing the carbon footprint of building energy systems (BES). However, the volatility of the energy generation and its mismatch with the typical demand patterns are cause for concern, particularly from the viewpoint of the management of the power grid. This paper aims to show the influence of the orientation of photovoltaic panels in designing new BES and to provide support to the decision making process of optimal PV placing. The subject is addressed with a mixed integer linear optimization problem, with costs as objectives and the installation, tilt, and azimuth of PV panels as the main decision variables. Compared with existing BES optimization approaches reported in literature, the contribution of PV panels is modeled in more detail, including a more accurate solar irradiation model and the shading effect among panels. Compared with existing studies in PV modeling, the interaction between the PV panels and the remaining units of the BES, including the effects of optimal, scheduling is considered. The study is based on data from a residential district with 40 buildings in western Switzerland. The results confirm the relevant influence of PV panels’ azimuth and tilt on the performance of BES. Whereas south-orientation remains the most preferred choice, west-orientationed panels better match the demand when compared with east-orientationed panels. Apart from the benefits for individual buildings, an appropriate choice of orientation was shown to benefit the grid: rotating the panels 20° westwards can, together with an appropriate scheduling of the BES, reduce the peak power of the exchange with the power grid by 50% while increasing total cost by only 8.3%. Including the more detailed modeling of the PV energy generation demonstrated that assuming horizontal surfaces can lead to inaccuracies of up to 20% when calculating operating expenses and electricity generated, particularly for high levels of PV penetration.

    **Abstract**

    Integrating intermittent renewable energy sources has renders the power network operator task of balancing electricity generation and consumption increasingly challenging. Aside from heavily investing in additional storage capacities, an interesting solution might be the use predictive control methods to shift controllable loads toward production periods. Therefore, this article introduces a systematic approach to provide a preliminary evaluation of the thermoeconomic impact of model predictive control (MPC) when being applied to modern and complex building energy systems (BES). The proposed method applies an ϵ-constraint multi-objective optimization to generate a large panel of different BES configurations and their respective operating strategies. The problem formulation relies on a holistic BES framework to satisfy the different building service requirements using a mixed-integer linear programming technique. To illustrate the contribution of MPC, different applications on the single- and multi-dwelling level are presented and analyzed. The results suggest that MPC can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources within the built environment by adjusting the heating and cooling demand to the fluctuating renewable generation, increasing the share of self-consumption by up to 27% while decreasing the operating expenses by up to 3% on the single-building level. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the national-wide potential is performed by means of an extended implementation on the Swiss building stock.

    **Abstract**

    In order to fully exploit the potential of renewable energy resources (RERs) for building applications, optimal design and control of the different energy systems is a compelling challenge to address. This paper presents a two-step multi-objective optimization approach to size both thermal and electrical energy systems in regard of thermo-economic performance indicators to suit consumer and grid operator interests. Several utilities such as storage, conversion systems, and RERs are hence modeled and formulated through mixed-integer linear programming. Simultaneously, the algorithm defines the optimal operation strategy, based on a model predictive control structure, for each deterministic unit embedded within the energy management system of the building to meet the different comfort and service requirements. The developed design framework is successfully applied on several energy systems configuration of typical Swiss building types. Different component sizes are analyzed, regarding the present investment cost and the self-consumption share. In addition, this paper presents a novel optimal design criteria based on the maximum cost benefits in the view of both the consumer and the distribution network operator.
