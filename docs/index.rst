Renewable Energy Hub Optimizer
==============================

Renewable Energy Hub Optimizer (REHO) is a decision support tool for sustainable urban energy system planning.

It is developed by EPFL (Switzerland), within the Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE) group.

REHO simultaneously addresses the optimal design and operation of capacities, catering to multi-objective
considerations across economic, environmental, and efficiency criteria. Its MILP framework, multi-objective
optimization, multi-scale adaptability, consideration of diverse end-use demands, and multi-energy integration drive
informed decision-making for renewable energy deployment in urban areas.

This documentation introduces REHO and highlights its key features and contributions to the field of
sustainable energy system planning.
