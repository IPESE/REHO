# REHO
Renewable Energy Hub Optimizer (REHO) is an open-source energy model suitable for the optimization of energy systems at building-scale or district-scale.
It considers simultaneously the optimal design as well as optimal scheduling of capacities.
It allows to investigate the deployment of energy conversion and energy storage capacities to ensure the energy balance of a specified territory,
through multi-objective optimization and KPIs parametric studies. It is based on an hourly resolution.

## Install
To run REHO, both AMPL and Python 3 needs to be installed. Further details can be found in the documentation : https://reho.readthedocs.io/en/main/.
