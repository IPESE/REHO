Examples
++++++++

This section reproduces the examples provided in the repository (these examples scripts are available in https://github.com/IPESE/REHO/tree/main/scripts/examples).

They should give you a brief overview of REHO's capabilities and to test the various features of the tool.

.. note::
    Since the content of the ``scripts/examples/`` subfolder is git-tracked, you should not modify these files directly, but rather copy their contents into any other subfolder of ``scripts/`` that you have yourself created. The content there (code, data, results, and figures) will be ignored by the git versioning.
