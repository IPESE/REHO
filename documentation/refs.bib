  abstract = {Following the pioneering work \&quot;Tokyo Half Project\&quot; promoted by the Alliance for Global Sustainability (AGS), a geographical information system has been developed to model the energy requirements of urban areas. The purpose of this platform is to model with sufficient details the energy services requirements of a given geographical area in order to allow the evaluation of the integration of advanced integrated energy conversion systems. This tool is used to study the emergence of more sustainable cities that realize energy efficiency improvement measures, integrate energy efficient conversion technologies and promote the use of endogenous renewable energy. It is based on techniques at the crossroads of three domains : geographical information systems, urban energy modelling and process integration and process design techniques. The model is illustrated with case studies for the energetic planning of urban district in Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation is typically connected to power distribution grids, which are not designed to host a large amount of production if it is significantly larger than their nominal electricity demand. Given the prominent role of PV in energy transition pathways, modeling the existing power distribution infrastructure’s constraints and limitations is key for its reliable techno-economical analysis and expansion. As countrywide models of the distribution grids are, in general, not available, this paper first tackles the problem of estimating medium voltage (MV) distribution grids starting from publicly available datasets. It then proposes a method to estimate the PV generation hosting capacity of such grids and extend it through energy storage systems. As a final contribution and ultimate objective, this paper proposes a method to derive cost-optimal plans for countrywide deployment of PV generation and energy storage systems considering the MV power distribution infrastructure’s technical limitations. The distributed PV generation potential is modeled with high-spatially resolved capacity factors. Results are discussed using Switzerland as a case study},

  abstract = {The residential sector accounts for a large share of worldwide energy consumption, yet is difficult to characterise, since consumption profiles depend on several factors from geographical location to individual building occupant behaviour. Given this difficulty, the fact that energy used in this sector is primarily derived from fossil fuels and the latest energy policies around the world (e.g., Europe 20-20-20), a method able to systematically integrate multi-energy networks and low carbon resources in urban systems is clearly required. This work proposes such a method, which uses process integration techniques and mixed integer linear programming to optimise energy systems at both the individual building and district levels. Parametric optimisation is applied as a systematic way to generate interesting solutions for all budgets (i.e., investment cost limits) and two approaches to temporal data treatment are evaluated: monthly average and hourly typical day resolution. The city center of Geneva is used as a first case study to compare the time resolutions and results highlight that implicit peak shaving occurs when data are reduced to monthly averages. Consequently, solutions reveal lower operating costs and higher self-sufficiency scenarios compared to using a finer resolution but with similar relative cost contributions. Therefore, monthly resolution is used for the second case study, the whole canton of Geneva, in the interest of reducing the data processing and computation time as a primary objective of the study is to discover the main cost contributors. The canton is used as a case study to analyse the penetration of low temperature, CO2-based, advanced fourth generation district energy networks with population density. The results reveal that only areas with a piping cost lower than 21.5 kEuro/100 m(ERA)(2) connect to the low-temperature network in the intermediate scenarios, while all areas must connect to achieve the minimum operating cost result. Parallel coordinates are employed to better visualise the key performance indicators at canton and commune level together with the breakdown of energy (electricity and natural gas) imports/exports and investment cost to highlight the main contributors},

  abstract = {The built environment currently represents the largest sector in terms of final energy consumption, both in Switzerland and the European Union. Most of the associated energy services, such as space heating and potable hot water preparation, are mainly satisfied by the combustion of fossil fuels, typically oil and natural gas. Hence, within the current context of national energy transition towards a sustainable and environment-friendly service provision, the building sector is facing a major challenge to integrate both efficient conversion technologies and additional renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, an increasing penetration of the latter is not a straightforward task; solar power, a typical resource available in urban areas, is indeed intrinsically volatile which renders a full exploitation of the generated electricity highly compelling. The implementation of advanced mathematical modelling methods during the phases of both design and operation represent a promising cornerstone to successfully reach the objectives targeted by the transition program.  Using a model-based approach, the following thesis therefore attempts in contributing to the latter challenge through three main targets. The first aims at the development of a holistic and modular modelling framework to optimally size and operate building energy systems. In order to provide multiple good trade-off system solutions to the various stakeholders, the proposed method relies on an epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimisation techniques and ad hoc defined key performance indicators. A systematic implementation of the thus developed framework finally allows the large-scale analysis of modern and efficient building energy systems, both in view of future market opportunities and national environmental targets.  The second topic focuses on the study of multi-building energy systems and analyses the potential benefits from involving multiple end-users during the sizing process. Through an extended system scope, potential synergies of neighbouring building types arise and hence, the initial modelling framework is further developed accordingly. Additional shared unit technologies, such as inter-day storage and heating networks become interesting elements for buildings interaction and therefore are also integrated in the modelling framework. Finally, the third target addresses the quantification of potential ancillary services performed by different energy system configurations to power network operators. Using a representative set of flexibility request profiles, the modelling framework is systematically solved to assess the associated temporal load shifting potential in comparison to standard electrical battery energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {Energy communities are key actors in the energy transition since they optimally interconnect renewable energy capacities with the consumers. Despite versatile objectives, they usually aim at improving the self-consumption of renewable electricity within low voltage electricity networks to maximize the revenues of the community. In addition, energy communities are an excellent opportunity to supply renewable electricity to regional and national grids. However, effective price signals have to be designed to coordinate the needs of the energy infrastructure with the interests of local stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the potentials of energy communities at the national level with a bottom up approach. A district energy system having a building scale resolution is modelled in a mixed integer linear programming problem. The Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is applied to reduce the computational time. The methodology lies within the framework of renewable energy hub, characterized by a high share of photovoltaic. Both investments into energy capacities and their operation are considered. The model is applied on a set of typical districts and weather locations representative of the whole Switzerland. The extrapolation to the national scale revealed a heterogeneous photovoltaic potential throughout the country. The actual electricity tariffs promote maximal investment into photovoltaic panels in every region, reaching a capacity of 28 GW and generating 32 TWh per year. Since the forecast national energy need is between 12 and 18 TWh per year, a coordinated design is needed to prevent unnecessary investments. An uncoordinated design increases the total costs of the residential energy system by 31\% and curtails 24\% of the onsite gener ated electricity. Moreover, the CO2,eq emission of the unnecessary investment is equivalent to 9\% of the actual emissions in the residential sector},
